## Getting Started

### Installation

To get started with Luma, install the package using `pip`:

```bash
pip install luma-ml
```

Or for a specific version,

```bash
pip install luma-ml==[any_version]
```

### Import

After installation, import Luma in your Python script to access its features:

```python
import luma
```

### Acceleration

Luma supports `MLX` based `NumPy` acceleration on **Apple Silicon**. By importing Lumaâ€™s neural package, it will automatically detect Appleâ€™s Metal Performance Shader(MPS) availability and directly apply MLX acceleration for all execution flows and operations using `luma.neural`.

```python
import luma.neural
```

Otherwise, the default CPU based operation is applied.

For more details, please refer to the link ðŸ”— shown at Lumaâ€™s neural package description.
